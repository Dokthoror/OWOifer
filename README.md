# OWOifer

## What is this

A fabulous owoifer written in shell !

## How to use it

To use this script as its full potential, you will need my [random-owo.sh](https://github.com/Dokthoror/Random-owo) script in your PATH environment variable but no worry, the script will run without it. UwU

To run the script, just type :

```bash
./owoifer.sh "and add your text here !"
```

The output will be something like :

```text
and add youw text hewe OωO
```

The quotes are not necessary. TωT
